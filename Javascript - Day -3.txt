
1 . Json iterate over all for loops.....

SOURCE CODE : 
 var marks = [45, 67, 70, 89];
// console.log(marks[2]);
// console.log(marks.length)

// for loop
for (var i = 1; i < marks.length; i++) {
    var result_For = ["i in for loop", marks[i]]
    console.log(result_For)
}
console.log(JSON.stringify(result_For))

// for...in -> i is index

for (var i in marks) {
    var result_ForIN = ["i in for in loop", marks[i]]
    console.log(result_ForIN)
}
console.log(JSON.stringify(result_ForIN))

//  for ... of -> val is to take value

for (val of marks) {
    var result_ForOF = ["i in for of loop", val]
    console.log(result_ForOF)
}
console.log(JSON.stringify(result_ForOF))

OUTPUT :

(2)¬†['i in for loop', 67]0: "i in for loop"1: 67length: 2[[Prototype]]: Array(0)

2 . Create your own resume data in JSON format

SOURCE CODE :

var resume = {
    pic: {
        picture: "Coolüòé of Ashok"
